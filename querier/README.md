***************
* EXTENSION USED
***************



I had an issue with my indexer were my files were randomly deleted and I had to rewrite my code. Due to this I started lab 6 late.
I also had issues with lab 6 and the professor granted me an extension which I have stated above.

In terms of my program, I am getting a seg fault at the very end of my fuzzquery testing.
